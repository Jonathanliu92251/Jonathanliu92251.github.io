 Integrals are the inverses of derivatives.


## Vector 向量
- r, length or magnitude of vector
- Theta = tan-1(y/x), angle of the vector, 
- addition, 3* multiplication
- multiplication
	- scalar: w = 2v 
	- dot product (for scalar product):
	 
	 v\*s =(v1⋅s1)+(v2⋅s2)...+(vn⋅sn)
    can use it to calculate the cosine of the angle between two vectors. 
    v *s = |v| |s| cos(θ)

	- cross product(vector product))
    
    	The result of this is a new vector that is at right angles to both the other vectors in 3D Euclidean space. p3 * q3 = r3:
    	
        r1=p2q3−p3q2, 
        r2=p3q1−p1q3, 
        r3=p1q2−p2q1

- Division: reciprocal or inverse N(-1) 逆
  A / B = A * B(-1)
  B * (B-1) = B(t) =I
- Transformations, Eigenvectors, and Eigenvalues  
Matrices and vectors are used together to manipulate spatial dimensions  
  - Linear Transformations    T(v)=Av 
    calculate the dot product by applying the RC rule; T: Rm -> Rn
  - Transformations of Magnitude and Amplitude  
  	When you multiply a vector by a matrix, you transform it in at least one of the following two ways:
  		- Scale the length (magnitude) of the matrix to make it longer or shorter
    	- Change the direction (amplitude) of the matrix

    	An Afine transformation multiplies a vector by a matrix and adds an offset vector, sometimes referred to as bias; like this:
    	T(X) = AX + B 

- Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

	So we can see that when you transform a vector using a matrix, we change its direction, length, or both. When the transformation only affects scale (in other words, the output vector has a different magnitude but the same amplitude as the input vector), the matrix multiplication for the transformation is the equivalent operation as some scalar multiplication of

## Conditional Probability and Dependence

### Probability

Many of the problems we try to solve using statistics are to do with probability. For example, what's the probable salary for a graduate who scored a given score in their final exam at school? Or, what's the likely height of a child given the height of his or her parents?

It therefore makes sense to learn some basic principles of probability as we study statistics.
Probability Basics

Let's start with some basic definitions and principles.

    An experiment or trial is an action with an uncertain outcome, such as tossing a coin.
    A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. In a coin toss, there's a set of two possible oucomes (heads and tails).
    A sample point is a single possible outcome - for example, heads)
    An event is a specific outome of single instance of an experiment - for example, tossing a coin and getting tails.
    Probability is a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the likelihood of a particular event, with 0 meaning that the event is impossible, and 1 meaning that the event is inevitable. In general terms, it's calculated like this:

### Conditional Probability and Dependence

Events can be:

    Independent (events that are not affected by other events)
    Dependent (events that are conditional on other events)
    Mutually Exclusive (events that can't occur together)

### Binomial Variables and Distributions    
A binomial variable is used to count how frequently an event occurs in a fixed number of repeated independent experiments 


P(x=k)=n!/(k!*(n−k)!) *p^k *(1−p)^(n−k)

### Sample and Sampling Distributions
- Confidence Intervals

- Working with Sampling Distributions

	This means we need to allow for some variation between the sample statistics and the true parameters of the full population.
